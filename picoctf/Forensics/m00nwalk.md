### CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION: 
Decode this message from the moon.
How did pictures from the moon landing get sent back to Earth?
What is the CMU mascot?, that might help select a RX option.

Using the first hint I found out that for Apollo 11 SSTV was used to decode the signals.
Hence I used an online SSTV decoder and uploaded the file and got an image.
In the image the flag was given.
